# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

This case study focuses on the Rich Data Corporation (RDC) - an emerging credit risk management provider. The company was founded in 2015 by Ada Guan, Michael Coomer, Charles Guan and Gordon Campbell (1). The founders had banking and software backgrounds and saw the opportunity to bolster financial inclusion by creating more accurate credit risk models for lending by incoprorating behavioural data from a number of alternate sources(2). In June of 2021 the company raised $15m from strategic investors to enable its growth initiatives in Australia and abroad (3). 

## Business Activities:

The RDC founders believed the existing lending criteria and credit decisioning process was biased toward property owners, especially for SME loan applications. RDC wanted to create a new way to not only assess credit worthiness, but also to help predict future behaviour for those applicants with a short or limited credit history. RDC was created to help lenders assess applicants in new and data-driven ways, helping to reduce financial exclusion and furthermore provide credit for growing businesses, while reducing decision time (4). Importantly for RDC, the COVID pandemic has rendered past behaviour a weaker predictor than it once was and presents an opportunity for RDC to enable borrowers and lenders to adapt to this paradigm shift. 

RDC's intended customers are bank and non-bank lenders globally. In Australia, RDC's decisioning platform "Delta" is currently utilized by NAB, Westpac and Judo bank. The Total Adressable Market (TAM) for RDC's AI SaaS platform (AI and analytics) is over $1 trillion in global banking (5).

RDC's AI-powered Software as a Service (SaaS) decisioning platform is the flagship product which allows lenders to see why and how decisions are made. RDC provides a single SaaS platform for AI modelling, credit strategy and decisioning, across the entire credit lifecycle. The Delta platform can also forecast future borrower behaviour, which in turn helps lenders more accurately estimate revenues and expenses, while enhancing their ability to judge credit worthiness. The use of AI increases the accuracy of predictions and decisions, meaning banks and lenders can rapidly configure and deploy new products, giving financial institutions a unique competitive edge. 

RDC uses explainable artificial intelligence and predictive machine learning models, traditional and alternative data sources to provide more accurate, transparent and compliant credit decisions (6). When RDC implement Machine Learning solutions there are three main steps; prototyping (data extract), productionising (automation) and translating predictions into decisions (process and people). The RDC AI platform can be hosted by RDC as a SaaS on Amazon Web Services (AWS) or client hosted using the AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) (8). 
## Landscape:

RDC operates in the credit (lending) domain, with a focus on business lending in 2022. Specifically RDC is capitalising on the explosion of data and advancements in AI, which have both lead to clients (lenders0 increasing the ways credit is delivered and therefore grown.

The lending landscape was changed forever during the global financial crisis and the years that followed. Many traditional banking and financial services firms were either destroyed or severely reduced their balance sheets as a result of the losses. The subsequent rise of credit standards, compliance and regulation further hamstrung the incumbent lenders. As the global economy finally stabilized and growth returned, it was clear both consumers and businesses looking for credit had been frozen out of conventional borrowing markets despite abundant central bank liquidity aimed at addressing this very challenge. Alongside the rise of big data, AI and smartphones, many fintechs looked to transform the friction of credit origination and application processes and turned them to their advantage. Alas RDC ensures the outcome is a significantly enhanced capability to lend to more customers with lower risk and default rates.

The major competitors in this domain with comparable ambitions are Equifax, Experian, illion and FICO.
