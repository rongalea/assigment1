# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

This case study focuses on the Rich Data Corporation (RDC) - an emerging credit risk management provider. The company was founded in 2015 by Ada Guan, Michael Coomer, Charles Guan and Gordon Campbell (1). The founders had banking and software backgrounds and saw the opportunity to bolster financial inclusion by creating more accurate credit risk models for lending by incoprorating behavioural data from a number of alternate sources(2). In June of 2021 the company raised $15m from strategic investors to enable its growth initiatives in Australia and abroad (3). 

## Business Activities:

The RDC founders believed the existing lending criteria and credit decisioning process was biased toward property owners, especially for SME loan applications. RDC wanted to create a new way to not only assess credit worthiness, but also to help predict future behaviour for those applicants with a short or limited credit history. RDC was created to help lenders assess applicants in new and data-driven ways, helping to reduce financial exclusion and furthermore provide credit for growing businesses, while reducing decision time (4). Importantly for RDC, the COVID pandemic has rendered past behaviour a weaker predictor than it once was and presents an opportunity for RDC to enable borrowers and lenders to adapt to this paradigm shift. 

RDC's intended customers are bank and non-bank lenders globally. In Australia, RDC's decisioning platform "Delta" is currently utilized by NAB, Westpac and Judo bank. The Total Adressable Market (TAM) for RDC's AI SaaS platform (AI and analytics) is over $1 trillion in global banking (5).


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) RDC's AI-powered Saas decisioning platform is the flagship product which allows lenders to see why and how decisions are made. RDC provides a single SaaS platform for AI modelling, credit strategy and decisioning, across the entire credit lifecycle. The Delta platform can also forecast future borrower behaviour, which in turn helps lenders more accuratle estimate revenues and expenses, while enhancing their ability to judge credit worthiness.  

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

RDC uses explainable artificial intelligence and predictive machine learning models, traditional and alternative data sources to provide more accurate, transparent and compliant credit decisions (6).
